# LInear MOdeling of EEG data

The LInear MOdelling of EEG data (LIMO EEG) toolbox is a Matlab toolbox dedicated to the statistical analysis of MEEG data. It is interfaced with EEGLAB to act as a plug in. However, once data are imported all is performed within LIMO EEG and the toolbox can thus work for any data sets.

This repo is the stable version of LIMO EEG (v2) to be used with EEGLAB (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) for your research applications. The previous version (1.5) is now archived here: http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2190

## Documentation
in the doc directory (a bit outdated)
and of course the [wiki](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_eeg/wiki)

## LIMO tutorial dataset

With the software we released a dataset that can now be cited and downloaded here: http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2189
